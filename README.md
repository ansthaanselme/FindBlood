ALX Webstack - Portfolio Project

### Intro
FindBlood is a web based blood bank management system, where user can search blood anonymously, however for requesting blood or for registering into a camp a user need to be authenticated. The main idea is to connect all the blood banks and needy people on a single platform to help each other by saving lives and time.

A user can register on FindBlood and request blood as well as register into a camp either as a donor or volunteer. For registering into a camp as a volunteer, the user can select a role of a volunteer as per their interest. For each successful request or transaction the user will receive a email which would be the proof for the same. The main goal was to learn Spring boot and Angular. This project was made to show what we have learned.
